## About

Thanks for dropping by. I started my career as a historian focusing on the
expansion of the colonial frontier in Virginia, looking at a neighborhood in
the Borden Land Grant named Timber Ridge which was first settled in 1737.

I attended graduate school at [William and Mary](http://wm.edu) and worked at the [Colonial
Williamsburg Foundation](http://history.org) as an intern in their [Department of Historical
Research](http://research.history.org). I continued working there after graudate school as an associate historian and database administrator. Working closely with the [Rockefeller Library Archives](http://research.history.org/library/), we set out to
digitize architectural research reports, the library's collection of 17th and
18th century materials, build historic maps of the town, and databases of court
records for use by larger scholarly audiences.

During my time at the Foundation, I became really interested in technology to
make my life easier. I became a Microsoft Certified Database Administrator
(MCDBA) and took a position with the [Earl Gregg Swem Library](http://swem.wm.edu) at the College of
William and Mary. There I worked on improving the server infrastructure of the
library, implementing an institutional repository, building a computer graphics
and scientific visualization center, and numerous digital humanities projects.
I also contributed to the [VuFind](http://vufind.org) project as one of the first contributors, as
well as what has become [Project Blacklight](http://projectblacklight.org/) and <a href="https://github.com/solrmarc">SolrMarc</a>.

I'm currently the Head of Reseach &amp; Development at the University of
Virginia Library's <a href="http://scholarslab.org">Scholars' Lab</a>. Since
joining in 2009, I've lead teams working on projects like
<a href="http://neatline.org">Neatline</a>, implementing geospatial search and
discovery, and starting the Praxis Program. I have mentored numerous graduate
students through the Praxis and DH Fellows programs, taught early career
humanities scholars about programming at [Humanities Intensive Learning and Teaching](http://www.dhtraining.org/hilt/), and taught in the [Historic
Preservation](http://www.arch.virginia.edu/academics/disciplines/preservation) program at the University of Virginia.
